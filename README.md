# NetSuite-ItemReceiptLocationFix
With the default way that NetSuite is set up, the to and from locations on an item receipt are labeled wrong. An easy fix for this would be to simply relabel the fields yourself, but for some users, myself included, there is already scripting and workflows that rely on these fields set in place. 

This script fixes the base issue of the record being created with the wrong information.
